# CycleGAN: Image Translation using CycleGAN in Pytorch
This repository contains a simple pytorch implementation of CycleGAN for Image Translation from Apple to Orange fruit.
- Image Translation Dataset: [Apple to Orange Dataset](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/cyclegan/datasets/)
- Image Resolution: 128 x 128
